# Shopping Distributed Spring Boot Demo using REST Synchronous Communication

This is a simple distributed application composed of two components, each
deployed as a separate Java application:

- Catalogue
- Cart (Shopping Cart)

The _Cart_ component depends on information available in the _Catalogue_
component, such as the catalogue item's _id_ and _caption_. These components are
connected through a synchronous REST API, making the _Cart_ component dependent
on the _Catalogue_. As a result, the _Cart_ component cannot function
independently, and both components are required for the _Cart_ component to
operate as expected.

This distributed application sacrifices _partition tolerance_ and _availability_
in favor of _consistency_. Other tradeoffs are possible but are not explored
here.

## Observability

One of the main challenges in any distributed system is observability. This
example also addresses observability using
[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/). Traces, metrics, and logs are
captured from all applications and collected in one place, the
[OpenTelemetry Collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/). Various
tools can be used to observe some or all of this data, such as:

| Category | Name                                          | URL                                               |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Traces   | [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/)       | [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686)  |
| Traces   | [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/)                  | [http://localhost:9411](http://localhost:9411)    |
| Metrics  | [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)          | [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)    |
| Logs     | [Grafana Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) | Cannot access this directly. Use Grafana instead. |
| All      | [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)               | [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)    |

The following image illustrates how these components are interconnected:

![OpenTelemetry Architecture](./assets/images/OpenTelemetry%20Architecture.png)

To simplify the setup, all these components are defined as services within a
`docker-compose.yml` file.

```yml

```

Note that this is just a demo; **none of this configuration is
production-ready**. For production setups, please refer to the respective tool
and technology documentation for proper configurations.

OpenTelemetry provides an easy, non-invasive way to collect observability data
from the application’s components. In this example, we are using
[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) in conjunction with the
[OpenTelemetry Spring Boot Starter project](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/zero-code/java/spring-boot-starter/),
as shown below:

```xml
        <!-- OpenTelemetry -->
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.opentelemetry.instrumentation</groupId>
            <artifactId>opentelemetry-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.opentelemetry.instrumentation</groupId>
            <artifactId>opentelemetry-jdbc</artifactId>
            <version>${opentelemetry.instrumentation.version}-alpha</version>
            <scope>runtime</scope>
        </dependency>
```

To fully leverage `opentelemetry-jdbc`, you must use the OpenTelemetry JDBC
driver (`io.opentelemetry.instrumentation.jdbc.OpenTelemetryDriver`) and
connection URL
(`jdbc:otel:h2:mem:demo-catalogue;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE;MODE=MYSQL`),
as shown below:

```yml
  datasource:
    hikari:
      driver-class-name: 'io.opentelemetry.instrumentation.jdbc.OpenTelemetryDriver'
      jdbc-url: 'jdbc:otel:h2:mem:demo-catalogue;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE;MODE=MYSQL'
```

No additional code changes are required to get started with OpenTelemetry, as
the OpenTelemetry collector will run on the same machine as the demo. In a
production environment, you would need to configure where the OpenTelemetry
collector is running so that each component knows where to send the data.

The log level for this application has been set to `DEBUG` for the
`org.springframework.web` package to generate logs:

```yml
logging:
  level:
    org.springframework.web: DEBUG
```

This log level is not recommended for production systems, as it can generate a
significant amount of logs. We are using `DEBUG` in this demo so that logs from
the applications can be observed in one place.

## Preloaded data

To keep things simple, we are using an
[H2](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) in-memory database preloaded
with the following data:

- **Catalog Items**

  | `id` | `caption`     | `description`                                                         |
  | ---: | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  |    1 | Leather Sofa  | A very nice and comfortable sofa                                      |
  |    2 | Wooden Table  | A large table ideal for 6 to 8 people                                 |
  |    3 | Plastic Chair | A robust plastic chair ideal for children and adults alike            |
  |    4 | Mug           | The ideal way to start the day                                        |
  |    5 | LED TV        | A very large TV set, ideal for those who love to binge-watch TV shows |

- **Carts**

  | `id` |
  | ---: |
  |    1 |
  |    2 |
  |    3 |

- **Cart Items**

  | `cart_id` | `item_id` | `quantity` |
  | --------: | --------: | ---------: |
  |         1 |         1 |          1 |
  |         1 |         5 |          1 |
  |         2 |         2 |          1 |
  |         2 |         3 |          6 |
  |         3 |         4 |          4 |

The `cart_id` and `item_id` in the cart items table are not enforced foreign
keys to the cart and catalogue item tables/databases, respectively.

## Prerequisites

- [Oracle Java 21](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21)
  is required to build and run the application
- A container runtime, such as [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima),
  with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) support to start the
  observability stack.

## Run the example

1. **Start the observability stack**

   This demo uses various tools and technologies to provide a holistic view of a
   distributed application composed of multiple components. Metrics, traces, and
   logs are collected from all components by the OpenTelemetry Collector and
   accessed via several tools, as shown below:

   ![OpenTelemetry Architecture](./assets/images/OpenTelemetry%20Architecture.png)

   Note that this is just a demo; **none of this configuration is
   production-ready**. Please refer to the respective tools and technologies for
   information on setting these up in a production environment.

   Start the observability stack:

   ```shell
   # Start the observability stack
   docker-compose --file 'containers/docker-compose.yml' up --detach

   # Wait for Grafana to start
   while [ "$(curl --silent --output /dev/null --write-out '%{http_code}' 'http://localhost:3000/login')" -ne '200' ]
   do
     echo 'Waiting for the observability stack to start'
     sleep 1
   done
   ```

   (_Optional_) Access each service:

   | Category | Name                                          | URL                                               |
   | -------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
   | Traces   | [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/)       | [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686)  |
   | Traces   | [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io/)                  | [http://localhost:9411](http://localhost:9411)    |
   | Metrics  | [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)          | [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)    |
   | Logs     | [Grafana Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) | Cannot access this directly. Use Grafana instead. |
   | All      | [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)               | [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)    |

2. **Build all Application**

   This step builds both projects, runs the tests, and copies the fat JAR files
   into the [`./.demo` directory](./.demo).

   ```shell
   rm -rf './.demo'
   ../mvnw clean package
   ```

   All tests should pass.

   (Optional) Verify that the fat JAR files were created and copied:

   ```shell
   tree --charset=ascii --dirsfirst --sort=name -L 1 --prune './.demo'
   ```

   The fat JAR files from both projects

   ```
   ./.demo
   |-- demo-shopping-distributed-rest-cart-1.0.0.jar
   `-- demo-shopping-distributed-rest-catalogue-1.0.0.jar

   1 directory, 2 files
   ```

3. **Run the Application**

   The _Cart_ component depends on the _Catalogue_ component, so it’s
   recommended to start the _Catalogue_ component first. Starting the _Cart_
   component without the _Catalogue_ component will result in failure once a
   request is made, as the _Cart_ component relies on the _Catalogue_ to be up
   and running.

   Both components are started in the background for convenience, but you can
   also run them in different terminal sessions if you prefer.

   1. **Run the _Catalogue_ component in the background**:

      ```shell
      # Start the application in the background
      java -jar './.demo/demo-shopping-distributed-rest-catalogue-1.0.0.jar' > './.demo/output-catalogue.txt' 2>&1 &

      # Wait for the application to start
      while [ "$(curl --silent --output /dev/null --write-out '%{http_code}' 'http://localhost:8081/catalogue/item/1')" -ne '200' ]
      do
        echo 'Waiting for the Catalogue component to start'
        sleep 1
      done
      ```

   2. **Run the _Cart_ component in the background**:

      ```shell
      # Start the application in the background
      java -jar './.demo/demo-shopping-distributed-rest-cart-1.0.0.jar' > './.demo/output-cart.txt' 2>&1 &

      # Wait for the application to start
      while [ "$(curl --silent --output /dev/null --write-out '%{http_code}' 'http://localhost:8082/cart/1')" -ne '200' ]
      do
        echo 'Waiting for the Cart component to start'
        sleep 1
      done
      ```

   Note that both components are running on different ports, and the _Cart_
   component expects the _Catalogue_ to be listening on port `8081`.

   | Component   |   Port |
   | ----------- | -----: |
   | _Catalogue_ | `8081` |
   | _Cart_      | `8082` |

4. **Try the Application**

   By interacting with the application, you will generate metrics, traces, and
   logs that can be observed through the observability tools.

   1. **Request a catalogue item**

      The database contains the following catalogue items, as shown in the
      following table.

      | `id` | `caption`     | `description`                                                         |
      | ---: | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
      |    1 | Leather Sofa  | A very nice and comfortable sofa                                      |
      |    2 | Wooden Table  | A large table ideal for 6 to 8 people                                 |
      |    3 | Plastic Chair | A robust plastic chair ideal for children and adults alike            |
      |    4 | Mug           | The ideal way to start the day                                        |
      |    5 | LED TV        | A very large TV set, ideal for those who love to binge-watch TV shows |

      ```shell
      curl --silent 'http://localhost:8081/catalogue/item/1' | jq
      ```

      The catalogue item with id `1`

      ```json
      {
        "id": 1,
        "caption": "Leather Sofa",
        "description": "A very nice and comfortable sofa"
      }
      ```

   2. **Request a cart**

      The database also contains the following carts, with their respective
      catalogue items and quantities, as shown in the following table.

      | `cart_id` | `item_id` | `caption`     | `quantity` |
      | --------: | --------: | ------------- | ---------: |
      |         1 |         1 | Leather Sofa  |          1 |
      |         1 |         5 | LED TV        |          1 |
      |         2 |         2 | Wooden Table  |          1 |
      |         2 |         3 | Plastic Chair |          6 |
      |         3 |         4 | Mug           |          4 |

      ```shell
      curl --silent 'http://localhost:8082/cart/1' | jq
      ```

      The cart item with id `1`

      ```json
      {
        "id": 1,
        "items": [
          {
            "id": 1,
            "caption": "Leather Sofa",
            "quantity": 1
          },
          {
            "id": 5,
            "caption": "LED TV",
            "quantity": 1
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

   3. **Add a new catalogue item**

      Add the following item to the catalogue

      | Property Name | Value                                   |
      | ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
      | `caption`     | Green Plant                             |
      | `description` | Put a little life in your living room!! |

      ```shell
      # Save the response in a file as we will use it later on
      curl --silent \
        -X POST 'http://localhost:8081/catalogue/item' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{"caption":"Green Plant","description":"Put a little life in your living room!!"}' \
        | jq \
        > './.demo/new-catalogue-item.json'

      # Print the output
      jq . './.demo/new-catalogue-item.json'
      ```

      This will return the newly added catalogue item together with its id.

      ```json
      {
        "id": 6,
        "caption": "Green Plant",
        "description": "Put a little life in your living room!!"
      }
      ```

      Print the new catalogue item id

      ```shell
      # Print the new catalogue item id
      ITEM_ID="$(jq .id './.demo/new-catalogue-item.json')"
      echo "New catalogue item id: ${ITEM_ID}"
      ```

      The newly created catalogue item id

      ```
      New catalogue item id: 6
      ```

   4. **Add the new catalogue item to cart**

      Please note that this depends on the previous step.

      Fetch the cart details.

      ```shell
      curl --silent 'http://localhost:8082/cart/3' | jq
      ```

      The current cart contents

      ```json
      {
        "id": 3,
        "items": [
          {
            "id": 4,
            "caption": "Mug",
            "quantity": 4
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

      Read the new item id obtained from the previous step and fetch the
      catalogue item.

      ```shell
      # Read the new item id obtained from the previous command
      ITEM_ID="$(jq .id './.demo/new-catalogue-item.json')"

      # Fetch the new catalogue item
      curl --silent "http://localhost:8081/catalogue/item/${ITEM_ID}" | jq
      ```

      The newly created catalogue item

      ```json
      {
        "id": 6,
        "caption": "Green Plant",
        "description": "Put a little life in your living room!!"
      }
      ```

      Add the newly created catalogue item to the cart.

      ```shell
      # Read the new item id obtained from the previous command
      ITEM_ID="$(jq .id './.demo/new-catalogue-item.json')"

      # Add the new item to cart with id 3
      curl --silent -X POST "http://localhost:8082/cart/3/item/${ITEM_ID}" | jq
      ```

      The cart contents after adding the newly created catalogue item.

      ```json
      {
        "id": 3,
        "items": [
          {
            "id": 4,
            "caption": "Mug",
            "quantity": 4
          },
          {
            "id": 6,
            "caption": "Green Plant",
            "quantity": 1
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

5. **Analyse the collected metrics, traces and logs**

   In this section we will go through all the tools and see how to use them to
   analyse a distributed application as a whole.

   1. **Prometheus (_Metrics_)**

      1. [Access Prometheus (http://localhost:9090/)](http://localhost:9090/).
         In our configuration, no credentials are needed. Needless to say that
         this is not the way one should configure this is a production
         environment. Please refer to the
         [Prometheus security model](https://prometheus.io/docs/operating/security/)
         for more information about how to secure Prometheus.

         ![Prometheus Landing page](./assets/images/Prometheus%20-%20Landing%20Page.png)

      2. Filter the metrics that you like to view. In this following example, we
         will use the `http_client_request_duration_seconds_sum`, but any metric
         will do.

         ![Filter metrics](./assets/images/Prometheus%20-%20Add%20metrics.png)

   2. **Jaeger (_Traces_)**

      1. [Access Jaeger (http://localhost:16686/search)](http://localhost:16686/search).
         In our configuration, no credentials are needed. Needless to say that
         this is not the way one should configure this is a production
         environment. Please refer to the
         [Securing Jaeger Installation](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.61/security/)
         for more information about how to secure Jaeger.

         ![Jaeger Landing page](./assets/images/Jaeger%20-%20Landing%20Page.png)

      2. Select the _Cart_ service from the _Service_ dropdown option, and click
         the _Find Traces_ button.

         ![Select the Cart service](./assets/images/Jaeger%20-%20Select%20the%20Cart%20service.png)

      3. Pick one of the traces and click on it to expand it.

         ![Analyse trace](./assets/images/Jaeger%20-%20Analyse%20trace.png)

      4. View the
         [System Architecture tab (http://localhost:16686/dependencies)](http://localhost:16686/dependencies)

         ![System Architecture](./assets/images/Jaeger%20-%20System%20Architecture.png)

         This will show you a view of how the application communicates. By
         looking at this view, you can have a good overview of all system
         components (that are exporting traces) and who is communicating with
         whom.

   3. **Zipkin (_Traces_)**

      1. [Access Zipkin (http://localhost:9411/zipkin/)](http://localhost:9411/zipkin/).
         In our configuration, no credentials are needed. Needless to say that
         this is not the way one should configure this is a production
         environment. Unfortunately, there is
         [no built-in authentication in the UI](https://zipkin.io/pages/architecture.html)

         ![Zipkin Landing page](./assets/images/Zipkin%20-%20Landing%20Page.png)

      2. Click on the gear wheel and adjust the time frame, and then click on the _RUN QUERY_ button.

         ![Adjust time frame](./assets/images/Zipkin%20-%20Adjust%20time%20frame.png)

      3. Pick one of the traces and click on the respective _SHOW_ button to expand it.

         ![Analyse trace](./assets/images/Zipkin%20-%20Analyse%20trace.png)

      4. View the
         [Dependencies tab (http://localhost:9411/zipkin/dependency)](http://localhost:9411/zipkin/dependency)

         ![Dependencies](./assets/images/Zipkin%20-%20Dependencies.png)

         This will show you a view of how the application communicates. By
         looking at this view, you can have a good overview of all system
         components (that are exporting traces) and who is communicating with
         whom.

   4. **Grafana (_Metrics_, _Traces_, and _Logs_)**

      1. [Log into Grafana (http://localhost:3000/login)](http://localhost:3000/login)
         using the default username and password:`admin`/`admin`. You will be
         asked to change the password, which you can keep skip or retype `admin`
         (or any password you prefer).

         ![Log into Grafana](./assets/images/Grafana%20-%20Login.png)

      2. [Add a new connection (http://localhost:3000/connections/add-new-connection)](http://localhost:3000/connections/add-new-connection),
         from _Menu_ > _Connections_ > _Add new connection_, that gets the logs
         from both applications. Search for “Loki”

         ![Add new connection - Search for Loki](./assets/images/Grafana%20-%20Add%20new%20connection%20-%20Search%20for%20Loki.png)

         Click on the
         [Loki option](http://localhost:3000/connections/datasources/loki), and
         then click on the _Add new data source_ button.

         Provide the following connection url: `http://loki:3100`

         ![Add new connection - Loki](./assets/images/Grafana%20-%20Add%20new%20connection%20-%20Loki.png)

         Leave everything else as is, scroll to the bottom of the page and click
         _Save & test_. This should succeed as shown next.

         ![Add new connection - Loki - Save and test](./assets/images/Grafana%20-%20Add%20new%20connection%20-%20Loki%20-%20Save%20and%20test.png)

      3. [Explore the logs (http://localhost:3000/explore)](http://localhost:3000/explore),
         and switch the source to loki.

         ![Switch to Loki](./assets/images/Grafana%20-%20Explore%20-%20Switch%20to%20Loki.png)

      4. View the application logs. Add a label filter (`service_name = Cart`)
         and re-run the logs

         ![Cart logs](./assets/images/Grafana%20-%20Explore%20-%20Cart%20logs.png)

         Scroll down to the logs and analyse these

         ![Cart logs](./assets/images/Grafana%20-%20Explore%20-%20Expand%20Cart%20logs.png)

         Note that we have adjusted the log levels for both components to
         `DEBUG` and that’s why we are seeing som many log entries

      5. Filter by trace id. Each request made will have a unique trace id that
         stays with it across components until the request is fully completed.
         In this example, we will use the `a7c4138d6a4877a97f0debd89098977d`.
         Change query such that it includes all service and only shows the logs
         for the given trace id.

         ```
         {service_name=~".+"} | trace_id = `a7c4138d6a4877a97f0debd89098977d` |~ ``
         ```

         ![Filter logs by trace id](./assets/images/Grafana%20-%20Explore%20-%20Filter%20logs%20by%20trace%20id.png)

         Scroll down to view the logs that belong to the given trace id

         ![The logs that belong to trace id](./assets/images/Grafana%20-%20Explore%20-%20The%20logs%20that%20belong%20to%20trace%20id.png)

      Grafana can be used to view all the metrics, traces and logs but adding
      new data sources, such as
      [Prometheus](http://localhost:3000/connections/datasources/prometheus),
      [Jaeger](http://localhost:3000/connections/datasources/jaeger), and
      [Zipkin](http://localhost:3000/connections/datasources/zipkin), in a
      similar way we added the loki data source.

      | Data Source | Connection URL           |
      | ----------- | ------------------------ |
      | Prometheus  | `http://prometheus:9090` |
      | Jaeger      | `http://jaeger:16686`    |
      | Zipkin      | `http://zipkin:9411`     |

      ![Data sources](./assets/images/Grafana%20-%20Data%20sources.png)

      In the following example, Grafana is used to view the logs and traces
      together.

      ![Grafana - Explore - Logs and Traces.png](./assets/images/Grafana%20-%20Explore%20-%20Logs%20and%20Traces.png)

      Note that Grafana can also collect the data directly from the
      OpenTelemetry collector, and we don’t need to have Prometheus, Jaeger, and
      Zipkin

   This was just a brief overview of how we can use the data that the various
   components of the application send in a holistic way to help identifying
   issues and pinpoint their source.

6. **Stop the application once ready**

   Stop both the _Cart_ and the _Catalogue_ components in the reverse order in
   which these were started. Like that the _Cart_ component does not fail as
   the _Catalogue_ component is not up and running.

   ```shell
   kill "$(jcmd | grep 'demo-shopping-distributed-rest-cart-1.0.0.jar' | cut -d' ' -f1)"
   kill "$(jcmd | grep 'demo-shopping-distributed-rest-catalogue-1.0.0.jar' | cut -d' ' -f1)"
   ```

7. **Stop the observability stack once ready**

   ```shell
   docker-compose --file 'containers/docker-compose.yml' down
   ```
