# Shopping Distributed Spring Boot Demo using REST Synchronous communication

A simple distributed application that has two components, each deployed as a
separate Java application.

- Catalogue
- Cart (shopping cart)

The _Cart_ component depends on information available in the _Catalogue_
component, such as the catalogue item’s _id_ and, _caption_. The components are
connected through a synchronous REST API. The _Cart_ component depends on the
_Catalogue_, and it cannot run independently. Both components are required for
the _Cart_ component to function as expected.

This distributed application gives up _partition tolerance_ and _availability_
in favour of _consistency_. Other tradeoffs are also valid, but not explored
here.

## Preloaded data

To keep things simple, we’ll use the
[H2](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) in-memory database preloaded
with the following data:

- **Catalog Items**

  | `id` | `caption`     | `description`                                                         |
  | ---: | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  |    1 | Leather Sofa  | A very nice and comfortable sofa                                      |
  |    2 | Wooden Table  | A large table ideal for 6 to 8 people                                 |
  |    3 | Plastic Chair | A robust plastic chair ideal for children and adults alike            |
  |    4 | Mug           | The ideal way to start the day                                        |
  |    5 | LED TV        | A very large TV set, ideal for those who love to binge-watch TV shows |

- **Carts**

  | `id` |
  | ---: |
  |    1 |
  |    2 |
  |    3 |

- **Cart Items**

  | `cart_id` | `item_id` | `quantity` |
  | --------: | --------: | ---------: |
  |         1 |         1 |          1 |
  |         1 |         5 |          1 |
  |         2 |         2 |          1 |
  |         2 |         3 |          6 |
  |         3 |         4 |          4 |

The `cart_id` and `item_id` in the cart items table are (not enforced) foreign
keys to the cart and catalogue item tables/databases, respectively.

## Prerequisites

- [Oracle Java 21](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21)
- Container runtime, such as [Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima)
- [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/), that can be started using docker

  ```shell
  # Start the Jaeger
  docker run \
    --rm \
    --detach \
    --publish 4317:4317 \
    --publish 4318:4318 \
    --publish 9411:9411 \
    --publish 16686:16686 \
    --env COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HOST_PORT=:9411 \
    --name 'shopping-jaeger-demo' \
    'jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.60.0'

  # Wait for the Jaeger to start
  while [ "$(curl --silent --output /dev/null --write-out '%{http_code}' 'http://localhost:16686/search')" -ne '200' ]
  do
    echo 'Waiting for the Jaeger to start'
    sleep 1
  done
  ```

## Run the example

1. **Build all application**

   This builds both projects, runs the respective tests and then copies the fat
   JAR files into the [`./demo` directory](./demo).

   ```shell
   rm -rf './demo'
   ../mvnw clean package
   ```

   All tests should pass.

   (_Optional_) Verify that the fat JAR files were all created and copied.

   ```shell
   tree --charset=ascii --dirsfirst --sort=name -L 1 --prune './demo'
   ```

   The fat JAR files from both projects

   ```
   ./demo
   |-- demo-shopping-distributed-rest-cart-1.0.0.jar
   `-- demo-shopping-distributed-rest-catalogue-1.0.0.jar

   1 directory, 2 files
   ```

2. **Run the application**

   The _Cart_ component depends on the _Catalogue_, thus it is recommended to
   start the _Catalogue_ component first and then start the _Cart_ component.
   While the _Cart_ component starts without the _Catalogue_ component, it will
   fail once a request is made as it depends on the _Catalogue_ component to be
   up and running.

   The components are started in the background for convenience, and can be
   started in different terminal sessions if preferred.

   Run the _Catalogue_ component (in the background).

   ```shell
   # Start the application in the background
   java -jar './demo/demo-shopping-distributed-rest-catalogue-1.0.0.jar' > './demo/output-catalogue.txt' 2>&1 &

   # Wait for the application to start
   while [ "$(curl --silent --output /dev/null --write-out '%{http_code}' 'http://localhost:8081/catalogue/item/1')" -ne '200' ]
   do
     echo 'Waiting for the Catalogue component to start'
     sleep 1
   done
   ```

   Run the _Cart_ component (in the background).

   ```shell
   # Start the application in the background
   java -jar './demo/demo-shopping-distributed-rest-cart-1.0.0.jar' > './demo/output-cart.txt' 2>&1 &

   # Wait for the application to start
   while [ "$(curl --silent --output /dev/null --write-out '%{http_code}' 'http://localhost:8082/cart/1')" -ne '200' ]
   do
     echo 'Waiting for the Cart component to start'
     sleep 1
   done
   ```

   Note that both components are running on different ports. Also, the _Cart_
   component is expecting the _Catalogue_ component to be listening on part
   `8081`.

   | Component   |   Port |
   | ----------- | -----: |
   | _Catalogue_ | `8081` |
   | _Cart_      | `8082` |

3. **Try the application**

   1. **Request a catalogue item**

      The database contains the following catalogue items, as shown in the
      following table.

      | `id` | `caption`     | `description`                                                         |
      | ---: | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
      |    1 | Leather Sofa  | A very nice and comfortable sofa                                      |
      |    2 | Wooden Table  | A large table ideal for 6 to 8 people                                 |
      |    3 | Plastic Chair | A robust plastic chair ideal for children and adults alike            |
      |    4 | Mug           | The ideal way to start the day                                        |
      |    5 | LED TV        | A very large TV set, ideal for those who love to binge-watch TV shows |

      ```shell
      curl --silent 'http://localhost:8081/catalogue/item/1' | jq
      ```

      The catalogue item with id `1`

      ```json
      {
        "id": 1,
        "caption": "Leather Sofa",
        "description": "A very nice and comfortable sofa"
      }
      ```

   2. **Request a cart**

      The database also contains the following carts, with their respective
      catalogue items and quantities, as shown in the following table.

      | `cart_id` | `item_id` | `caption`     | `quantity` |
      | --------: | --------: | ------------- | ---------: |
      |         1 |         1 | Leather Sofa  |          1 |
      |         1 |         5 | LED TV        |          1 |
      |         2 |         2 | Wooden Table  |          1 |
      |         2 |         3 | Plastic Chair |          6 |
      |         3 |         4 | Mug           |          4 |

      ```shell
      curl --silent 'http://localhost:8082/cart/1' | jq
      ```

      The cart item with id `1`

      ```json
      {
        "id": 1,
        "items": [
          {
            "id": 1,
            "caption": "Leather Sofa",
            "quantity": 1
          },
          {
            "id": 5,
            "caption": "LED TV",
            "quantity": 1
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

   3. **Add a new catalogue item**

      Add the following item to the catalogue

      | Property Name | Value                                   |
      | ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
      | `caption`     | Green Plant                             |
      | `description` | Put a little life in your living room!! |

      ```shell
      # Save the response in a file as we will use it later on
      curl --silent \
        -X POST 'http://localhost:8081/catalogue/item' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{"caption":"Green Plant","description":"Put a little life in your living room!!"}' \
        | jq \
        > './demo/new-catalogue-item.json'

      # Print the output
      jq . './demo/new-catalogue-item.json'
      ```

      This will return the newly added catalogue item together with its id.

      ```json
      {
        "id": 6,
        "caption": "Green Plant",
        "description": "Put a little life in your living room!!"
      }
      ```

      Print the new catalogue item id

      ```shell
      # Print the new catalogue item id
      ITEM_ID="$(jq .id './demo/new-catalogue-item.json')"
      echo "New catalogue item id: ${ITEM_ID}"
      ```

      The newly created catalogue item id

      ```
      New catalogue item id: 6
      ```

   4. **Add the new catalogue item to cart**

      Please note that this depends on the previous step.

      Fetch the cart details.

      ```shell
      curl --silent 'http://localhost:8082/cart/3' | jq
      ```

      The current cart contents

      ```json
      {
        "id": 3,
        "items": [
          {
            "id": 4,
            "caption": "Mug",
            "quantity": 4
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

      Read the new item id obtained from the previous step and fetch the
      catalogue item.

      ```shell
      # Read the new item id obtained from the previous command
      ITEM_ID="$(jq .id './demo/new-catalogue-item.json')"

      # Fetch the new catalogue item
      curl --silent "http://localhost:8081/catalogue/item/${ITEM_ID}" | jq
      ```

      The newly created catalogue item

      ```json
      {
        "id": 6,
        "caption": "Green Plant",
        "description": "Put a little life in your living room!!"
      }
      ```

      Add the newly created catalogue item to the cart.

      ```shell
      # Read the new item id obtained from the previous command
      ITEM_ID="$(jq .id './demo/new-catalogue-item.json')"

      # Add the new item to cart with id 3
      curl --silent -X POST "http://localhost:8082/cart/3/item/${ITEM_ID}" | jq
      ```

      The cart contents after adding the newly created catalogue item.

      ```json
      {
        "id": 3,
        "items": [
          {
            "id": 4,
            "caption": "Mug",
            "quantity": 4
          },
          {
            "id": 6,
            "caption": "Green Plant",
            "quantity": 1
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

4. **Stop the application once ready**

   Stop both the _Cart_ and the _Catalogue_ components in the reverse order in
   which these were started. Like that the _Cart_ component does not fail as
   the _Catalogue_ component is not up and running.

   ```shell
   kill "$(jcmd | grep 'demo-shopping-distributed-rest-cart-1.0.0.jar' | cut -d' ' -f1)"
   kill "$(jcmd | grep 'demo-shopping-distributed-rest-catalogue-1.0.0.jar' | cut -d' ' -f1)"
   ```

## Clean up

1. **Stop Jaeger Once Ready**

   ```shell
   docker stop 'shopping-jaeger-demo'
   ```
