# Shopping Layered Monolithic Spring Boot Demo

A simple monolithic application that has two components.

- Catalogue
- Cart (shopping cart)

The _Cart_ component depends on information available in the _Catalogue_
component, such as the _CatalogueItem_ _id_ and _caption_.

Both components are deployed as a single Spring Boot web application.

This application uses the layered monolithic architecture style where the
classes are grouped based on their type as shown next.

```shell
tree --charset=ascii --dirsfirst --sort=name -L 1 './src/main/java/demo'
```

The top level packages

```
./src/main/java/demo
|-- common
|-- dao
|-- rest
|-- service
`-- Main.java

5 directories, 1 file
```

The project organisation does not reflect the domain.

The layered monolithic architecture style is a very common architecture style
where the application is partitioned technically. The classes are grouped by
technology stack. For example, the rest controllers are all under the
`demo.rest` package and all the data access classes are under the `demo.dao`
package. By just looking at the top level packages, one cannot tell what this
application is doing.

A book recommendations application, a dating application, or a games library
application would all have the same package structure as our application which
has nothing to do with domain. This means that technical partitioning hides any
business domain information as it groups classes based on their roles.

This organisation style has some limitations. Adding a new feature to the _Cart_
component will require changes in multiple packages, which works against
locality. Locality in software development refers to the principle of keeping
related elements of code (or data) physically close to each other within the
application. Thus all changes required are limited to one package.

## Preloaded data

To keep things simple, we’ll use the
[H2](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) in-memory database preloaded
with the following data:

- **Catalog Items**

  | `id` | `caption`     | `description`                                                         |
  | ---: | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  |    1 | Leather Sofa  | A very nice and comfortable sofa                                      |
  |    2 | Wooden Table  | A large table ideal for 6 to 8 people                                 |
  |    3 | Plastic Chair | A robust plastic chair ideal for children and adults alike            |
  |    4 | Mug           | The ideal way to start the day                                        |
  |    5 | LED TV        | A very large TV set, ideal for those who love to binge-watch TV shows |

- **Carts**

  | `id` |
  | ---: |
  |    1 |
  |    2 |
  |    3 |

- **Cart Items**

  | `cart_id` | `item_id` | `quantity` |
  | --------: | --------: | ---------: |
  |         1 |         1 |          1 |
  |         1 |         5 |          1 |
  |         2 |         2 |          1 |
  |         2 |         3 |          6 |
  |         3 |         4 |          4 |

The `cart_id` and `item_id` in the cart items table are foreign keys to the cart
and catalogue item tables, respectively.

## Prerequisites

- [Oracle Java 21](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java21)

## Run the example

1. **Build the application**

   ```shell
   ../mvnw clean package
   ```

   All tests should pass.

   (_Optional_) Verify that the fat JAR files were created.

   ```shell
   tree --charset=ascii --dirsfirst --sort=name -L 1 --prune './target'
   ```

   The fat and thin JAR files

   ```
   ./target
   |-- demo-shopping-monolithic-layered-1.0.0.jar
   `-- demo-shopping-monolithic-layered-1.0.0.jar.original

   1 directory, 2 files
   ```

2. **Run the applications**

   This application doesn’t have any dependencies and listens to web requests on
   port `8080` unless otherwise specified.

   ```shell
   # Start the application in the background
   java -jar './target/demo-shopping-monolithic-layered-1.0.0.jar' > './target/output.txt' 2>&1 &

   # Wait for the application to start
   while [ "$(curl --silent --output /dev/null --write-out '%{http_code}' 'http://localhost:8080/catalogue/item/1')" -ne '200' ]
   do
     echo 'Waiting for the application to start'
     sleep 1
   done
   ```

   This starts our application in the background and waits for it to start.

3. **Request a catalogue item**

   The database contains the following catalogue items, as shown in the
   following table.

   | `id` | `caption`     | `description`                                                         |
   | ---: | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
   |    1 | Leather Sofa  | A very nice and comfortable sofa                                      |
   |    2 | Wooden Table  | A large table ideal for 6 to 8 people                                 |
   |    3 | Plastic Chair | A robust plastic chair ideal for children and adults alike            |
   |    4 | Mug           | The ideal way to start the day                                        |
   |    5 | LED TV        | A very large TV set, ideal for those who love to binge-watch TV shows |

   ```shell
   curl --silent 'http://localhost:8080/catalogue/item/1' | jq
   ```

   The catalogue item with id `1`

   ```json
   {
     "id": 1,
     "caption": "Leather Sofa",
     "description": "A very nice and comfortable sofa"
   }
   ```

4. **Request a cart**

   The database also contains the following carts, with their respective
   catalogue items and quantities, as shown in the following table.

   | `cart_id` | `item_id` | `caption`     | `quantity` |
   | --------: | --------: | ------------- | ---------: |
   |         1 |         1 | Leather Sofa  |          1 |
   |         1 |         5 | LED TV        |          1 |
   |         2 |         2 | Wooden Table  |          1 |
   |         2 |         3 | Plastic Chair |          6 |
   |         3 |         4 | Mug           |          4 |

   ```shell
   curl --silent 'http://localhost:8080/cart/1' | jq
   ```

   The cart item with id `1`

   ```json
   {
     "id": 1,
     "items": [
       {
         "id": 1,
         "caption": "Leather Sofa",
         "quantity": 1
       },
       {
         "id": 5,
         "caption": "LED TV",
         "quantity": 1
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

5. **Add a new catalogue item**

   Add the following item to the catalogue

   | Property Name | Value                                   |
   | ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
   | `caption`     | Green Plant                             |
   | `description` | Put a little life in your living room!! |

   ```shell
   # Save the response in a file as we will use it later on
   curl --silent \
     -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/catalogue/item' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"caption":"Green Plant","description":"Put a little life in your living room!!"}' \
     | jq \
     > './target/new-catalogue-item.json'

   # Print the output
   jq . './target/new-catalogue-item.json'
   ```

   This will return the newly added catalogue item together with its id.

   ```json
   {
     "id": 6,
     "caption": "Green Plant",
     "description": "Put a little life in your living room!!"
   }
   ```

   Print the new catalogue item id

   ```shell
   # Print the new catalogue item id
   ITEM_ID="$(jq .id './target/new-catalogue-item.json')"
   echo "New catalogue item id: ${ITEM_ID}"
   ```

   The newly created catalogue item id

   ```
   New catalogue item id: 6
   ```

6. **Add the new catalogue item to cart**

   Please note that this depends on the previous step.

   Fetch the cart details.

   ```shell
   curl --silent 'http://localhost:8080/cart/3' | jq
   ```

   The current cart contents

   ```json
   {
     "id": 3,
     "items": [
       {
         "id": 4,
         "caption": "Mug",
         "quantity": 4
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

   Read the new item id obtained from the previous step and fetch the catalogue
   item.

   ```shell
   # Read the new item id obtained from the previous command
   ITEM_ID="$(jq .id './target/new-catalogue-item.json')"

   # Fetch the new catalogue item
   curl --silent "http://localhost:8080/catalogue/item/${ITEM_ID}" | jq
   ```

   The newly created catalogue item

   ```json
   {
     "id": 6,
     "caption": "Green Plant",
     "description": "Put a little life in your living room!!"
   }
   ```

   Add the newly created catalogue item to the cart.

   ```shell
   # Read the new item id obtained from the previous command
   ITEM_ID="$(jq .id './target/new-catalogue-item.json')"

   # Add the new item to cart with id 3
   curl --silent -X POST "http://localhost:8080/cart/3/item/${ITEM_ID}" | jq
   ```

   The cart contents after adding the newly created catalogue item.

   ```json
   {
     "id": 3,
     "items": [
       {
         "id": 4,
         "caption": "Mug",
         "quantity": 4
       },
       {
         "id": 6,
         "caption": "Green Plant",
         "quantity": 1
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

7. **Stop the application once ready**

   ```shell
   kill "$(jcmd | grep 'demo-shopping-monolithic-layered-1.0.0.jar' | cut -d' ' -f1)"
   ```
